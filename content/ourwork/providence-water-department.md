> "Providence Water moved into its 165,000 SF facility in October 2017 and was able to complete the project on time and within budget with the help of Creative Business Design (CBD). Jeff Lawson and his staff made every effort to meet our schedule constraints and offered Providence Water many options for cost savings with furniture that they have in stock. Their staff were always friendly, accommodating and professional and helped us overcome many design and construction challenges and conflicts utilizing their skills and experience. We are thankful for CBD and their staff for being part of our project and truly making this project so successful."
