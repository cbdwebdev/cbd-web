CBD moved Hilco Global's office this past December 2017. The project entailed moving 5 offices, 36 cubes, and other furniture from a 9,000 sq. ft. space in Dedham, MA to Batterymarch Park in Quincy, MA.

> "I’ve worked with Jeff Lawson of CBD Interiors on a few projects over the years from doing additional buildouts in our office to purchasing office furniture. The most recent project was this past December 2017 and involved an entire office move. The project entailed moving 5 offices, 36 cubes, and other furniture from a 9,000 sq. ft. space to another office in a different town. I spoke to Jeff months before our move and he said he would be ready when we needed him. Jeff’s communication throughout the entire process was excellent, not only with me, but also our vendors and the new landlord. If I had any questions or concerns, he always got back to me. He was right on top of everything. Everything he said for timing and pricing was as he quoted months before. When our timing changed on when we could move over the cubes, he was very flexible and met our timeline, even though he had under a weeks’ notice. For a project this size, or any for that matter, you need someone who has excellent communication skills and very detail oriented. That’s Jeff. He and his crew were a pleasure to work with and if I need any work done in the future, I’ll be calling Jeff."
